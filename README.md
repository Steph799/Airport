# The airport is a Full Stack app, implemented in ASP.Core and React
The project runs a simulator of an airpoort route. It manages landings and departures dynamically and saves in the data base an image of the airport every several seconds
(an airport image stands for all the important information that the app needs in order to reconstruct it without deforming anything). In addition it saves all the landings and 
departures that their process had been finished.
